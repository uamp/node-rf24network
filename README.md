# node-rf24network

Java implementation of maniagbug's rf24network using natevw's java implementation of RF24 for RPi

https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24Network/

https://github.com/natevw/node-nrf/

UNFINISHED - I still have a long way to go with completing this.  Most of the helper functions are complete, but is still lacking the real meat.  Any help is warmly welcome.

The code in the node_modules sub folder is just a direct copy (of natevw's code) with only one small edit - lowered the SPI speed to improve NRF reliability on the PI.
