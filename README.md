# node-rf24network

Java implementation of maniagbug's rf24network using natevw's java implementation of RF24 for RPi

https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24Network/

https://github.com/natevw/node-nrf/

Very much a work in progress.

The code in the node_modules sub folder is just a direct copy (of natevw's code) with only one small edit - lowered the SPI speed to improve NRF reliability.
